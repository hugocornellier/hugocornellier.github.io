    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. It is AgeLapse's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our app. This Privacy Policy applies to our app (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "AgeLapse"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the app. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our app, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.</p>

    <div class="section-title">1. Information Collection and Use</div>
    <p>AgeLapse does not collect or store any data. All application functions are local to your device, and your data is never transmitted over a network.</p>

    <div class="section-title">2. Types of Data Collected</div>
    <p><strong>Face Data</strong></p>
    <p>AgeLapse does not collect or store any facial data. We use MLKit to scan photos during the stabilization process and detect landmark positions, such as eyes. After these landmark positions are used for stabilization, they are discarded immediately.</p>

    <div class="section-title">3. Use of Data</div>
    <p>AgeLapse uses the detected landmark positions solely for the purpose of stabilizing and processing time-lapse videos based on facial features.</p>

    <div class="section-title">4. Data Sharing and Storage</div>
    <p><strong>Data Sharing</strong></p>
    <p>AgeLapse does not share your face data with any third parties because we do not collect or store such data. All processing is done locally on your device.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Storage</strong></p>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store facial data, there is no data related to facial landmarks stored on your device or on any remote servers.</p>

    <div class="section-title">5. Data Retention</div>
    <p>AgeLapse retains no face data. Landmark positions detected by MLKit are used only temporarily for stabilization and are discarded immediately after use.</p>

    <div class="section-title">6. Your Data Protection Rights</div>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. You can delete individual projects and their associated data through the project selection screen, or delete all application data by deleting AgeLapse from your device. As AgeLapse does not collect or store any data, note that deletion from your device will result in a permanent loss of all data.</p>

    <div class="section-title">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</div>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 24, 2024.</p>
